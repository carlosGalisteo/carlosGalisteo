### Hi I'm Carlos Galisteo ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I am an architect with a lot of interest in the development of Python code for the development of automations within the Revit API, although also very interested in the use and development of open source within the **Open BIM** framework and the interaction with .ifc files.
