### Hi, I'm Carlos Galisteo  

I am an architect with a strong interest in programming and its application to architecture.  
I started developing my first automations in the **Revit API** using Python, and from there I have expanded my focus towards the **Open BIM** ecosystem, exploring the use and development of open-source tools and workflows around **IFC files**.  

My motivation is to keep learning and experimenting with technologies that can improve efficiency, collaboration, and data quality in building projects, always with a practical and humble approach.
